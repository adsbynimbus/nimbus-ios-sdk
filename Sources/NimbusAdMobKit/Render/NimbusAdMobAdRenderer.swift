    /**
     The UIView returned from this method should have all of the data set from the native ad
     on children views such as the call to action, image data, title, privacy icon etc.
     The view returned from this method should not be attached to the container passed in as
     it will be attached at a later time during the rendering process.
     
     NOTE: DO NOT set nativeAd.delegate. Nimbus uses this delegate and forwards events as NimbusEvent. You may
     listen set AdController.delegate and listen to didReceiveNimbusEvent() and didReceiveNimbusError() instead.
     
     Please set the GADNativeAdView.nativeAd property at the appropriate time, as the correct timing may vary depending on the AdChoices settings.
     
     - Parameters:
     - container: The container the layout will be attached to
     - nativeAd: The AdMob native ad with the relevant ad information
     
     - Returns: Your custom UIView (must inherit GADNativeAdView). DO NOT attach the view to the hierarchy yourself.
